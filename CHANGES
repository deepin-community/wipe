	version 0.02 - Fixed behavioural bug: wouldn't chmod directories.

Fri Jul 24 13:45:02 EEST 1998
	version 0.03 - Added silent option.

Thu Aug  6 11:35:13 EEST 1998
	version 0.10 - Major changes in this version
                       added many conditional compilation statements for
                       portability. now has got auxiliary random seed
                       sources, which can be used if a /dev/random device is
                       not available. now can use RC6 for generating the
                       cryptographically-strong random stream for
                       overwriting the data, as well as arcfour. 
                       restructured source code. currently compiles under
                       Linux 2.0.35, SunOS 5.5.1 and AIX 4.1.
                       
Tue Aug 11 11:01:36 EEST 1998
	version 0.11 - Added compilation settings for Solaris 2.6 x86/SPARC,
	               FreeBSD 2.2.6-STABLE; fixed a bug in the pipe handling
	               in random.c (thanks to C.Mason for these).
	               lengthened the period of the RC6-based PRNG from
	               an average 2^127 to a full 2^128 (thanks to John Kelsey
	               <kelsey@plnet.net> for explaining the period issues).

Wed Apr 14 15:32:54 EEST 1999
	version 0.12 - Fixed a very SERIOUS bug in fill_random: the upper half of
                       the target buffer was NOT filled, therefore HALF OF THE
                       DATA was not subject to the random passes.
                       now wipe works on block as well as character devices.
                       wipe also tries to wipe file names and file sizes.
                       new options for letting the wiped files on the filesystem
                       and inhibiting file name and file size wiping.

Fri Jun 18 14:47:27 CEST 1999
	version 0.13 - This version is SERIOUSLY BROKEN.
                       curiously the serious bug that should have been fixed in
                       version 0.12 popped up again. Thanks to Michael S. Rhee
                       for his diagnostic. I did some major changes in wipe's
                       inner workings. It now precalculates the different
                       fixed-pattern buffers. It is now able to do asynchronous
                       i/o to some extent, so that it can fill the random
                       buffers while the OS or the hardware is busy writing out
                       changes.  However asynchronous i/o (i.e. the O_NONBLOCK
                       flag) is not supported in current Linux kernels. The way
                       to do it would be to use a separate thread (or a process
                       but that would require use shared memory). However it is
                       faster now.

Sun Jun 20 17:16:30 CEST 1999
	version 0.14 - Consider version 0.13 as SERIOUSLY BROKEN. Filename
	               wiping has been cleaned up. Two extra options for
	               filename wiping have been added. Various bugs have
	               been fixed. This version is bug-free and 100% reliable.

Mon Jul 26 22:14:45 EEST 1999
	version 0.15 - Some minor fixes. Thanks to Thomas Schoepf and Alexey
                       Marinichev for their bug-reports and patches: wipe was
                       crashing when it was operating on a single zero-length
                       file. Also, wipe was screwing up when attempting to
                       rename a file (during filename wiping). Furthermore,
                       wipe will no more ask for confirmation over stderr if
                       stderr is not a tty; it will print an error message and
                       exit. Use "-f" (force) option in scripts. Also improved
                       general behaviour and presentation. Added well-defined
                       return codes.  Fixed a bug in length calculation. New
                       behaviour: wipe will now by default round up lengths to
                       the next multiple of file system block size so as to
                       wipe data possibly remaining in the last block of a
                       file; this behaviour can be inhibited with the new "-e"
                       option.

Thu Dec 30 21:50:59 CET 1999
	version 0.16 - Included fix by Jason Axley for compiling under Solaris
                       2.6.  Included patch sent by Paul H. Hargrove fixing a
                       serious bug (wipe-0.15 is making 34 random passes rather
                       than the proper mix of random and deterministic passes).

Mon Nov 25 23:13:45 CET 2002
        version 0.17 - Removed somewhat useless REMOVE_ON_INT define. Cosmetic
                       changes.  Added a -D option to make wipe follow symlinks
                       given on the command line.  Improved wiping statistics ;
                       now reports number of symlinks and special files encoun-
                       tered separately.  Updated e-mail addresses and URLs
                       (wow, free web hosting dies FAST !).  Plus CVS, reinden-
                       tation and Vim modelines.  I'd call this lifting.  Oh,
                       and it now should work on devices and files greater
                       than 2 gigabytes.  And I added some randomisation when
                       it tries the size of a file by resizing it.

Mon Feb  2 14:40:55 CET 2003
	version 0.18 - Arf, an important bugfix was lost during the v0.17 cleanup.
                       When called with -r option, wipe would traverse to parent
                       directories ! Fixed, again (thanks to Thomas).

Sat Sep 13 14:53:11 CEST 2003
	version 0.19 - wipe will hopefully work on large files now
        
Sat Jun 12 19:21:01 CEST 2004
        version 0.20 - Thanks to Jim Paris for a patch fixing the
                       large file issue.  Bumped up the version number a
                       bit.

Wed Sep 20 17:32:02 CEST 2006
        version 0.21 - Included Debian patch for severe bug that affected the
                       computation of the size of large partitions.

Sun Nov 07 09:30:10 EST 2010
        version 0.22 - Include patch by Karako Miklos to skip a number of patches.
                       Also did a clean up of headers (remove obsolete addresses
                       and CVS tags).

Tue Nov 11 08:06:35 EST 2010
        version 0.23 - To conform to Gutmann's paper, randomize only
                       deterministic passes (as pointed out by Karako) and not
                       the whole order.  (pointed out by K. Miklos).  Fix
                       unreadable message displayed with the -X option.

Wed Nov  2 23:24:07 PDT 2016
	version 0.24 - Integrated Debian patches from 0.22-4 per Joao
		       Eriberto Mota Filho's suggestion, except
                       50_hide-filenames.patch.
